% This work opens new opportunities for study, such as: (i) exploring different loss functions, to evaluate architectural and losses contributions distinctly (ii) study different network architectures (iii) exploring different merging functions, less sensitive to value fluctuations; (iv) explore regularization techniques to sustain larger amounts of consistent parallel outputs; (v) explore other network architectures and different image processing tasks and; (vi) study the insertion of mathematical morphology inside the network for image segmentation and border detection tasks \cite{Reis:2019}.

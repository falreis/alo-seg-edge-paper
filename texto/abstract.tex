%Identifying parts or objects in images is a effortless task for humans but a complex assignment for computers. 
Boundary detection and region segmentation have been extensively studied for over 50 years, with several approaches.
Latterly, machine learning, specially convolutional neural networks (CNN), have proven quite effective in solving these problems.
%The methods that exist today, despite the greater precision compared to some years ago, are still evolving and can be enhanced.
Under these techniques, an idea emerged in the last years in edge detection: combining features generated in multiple network layers.
Due to their architecture, CNNs produce different information along their layers, on a multiple scale, which, when combined, contribute to the final result with their own characteristics.
%Some works, aiming to increase performance, decided to train individual convolutional blocks to force this behavior, producing similar maps in muliple scales.
%This method, however, increases the cost and time of training, once it does not take advantage of information previously generated by correlated problems.
%This relationship between problems enables the production of good results with a low number of training epochs, making these solutions suitable to proof of concepts, conditions with high cost or events with close deadlines.
This work seeks to (I) propose trivial techniques, such as average, maximum and sum, and evaluate how them can be used yo combine features resulting from different layers of CNNs, (II) evaluates the influence of the number of intermediate results extracted from the network (side-outputs) over training and performance, and (III) analyze how to combine multiple ground truths annotations, presented in some data sets, into a single reference map to increase network convergence.
%, without generate similar multiple outputs, to produce boundary detection and region segmentation. %, using previous results from well-know object detection / classification networks.
%The creation of simple or even trivial methods favors the use in different scenarios, once there is no attempt to solve the uniqueness of each problem.
%The creation of simple or even trivial methods favors the use in different scenarios, becoming a generalist method.
The networks developed here were tested for region segmentation and edge detection tasks, with performance comparable to the literature, despite its simplicity.
In the edge detection task, our best results reached 0.780 ODS on the well-known BSDS500 data set. %, at \myFPS FPS.

% Computers and machines easily perform tasks that can be described using formal and mathematical rules.
% However, some trivial activities for human-beings, but difficult to describe formally, are a challenge for them.
% In the last few years, tasks of this latter group, such as object recognition, decision making and speech understanding also began to be performed by software, using machine learning techniques \cite[Ch. 1]{Goodfellow2016}.

% In computer vision, machines can detect objects and edges, identify patterns and segment regions.
% Although some computer vision reached or exceed human capabilities, research is still evolving.
% There is still room for improving techniques and solving practical problems \cite{Khan:2020}.
%This work aims to contribute to the improvement of methods of edge detection and region segmentation, using deep learning techniques.

% \subsection{Context and Motivation}
% \label{cap1_motivacao}

% Traditional segmentation methods use basic image properties to find discontinuities that can indicate objects, regions or borders.
% However, these techniques face practical problems, such as similar color patterns, noise, and multiple thresholds for groups of images.
% More recent techniques propose supervised methods using neural networks for edge detection and region segmentation, in which image characteristics are learned by algorithms \cite{MARTIN:1273918} \cite{Segnet:2017:7803544}.
%This approach reduces the need for manual pattern recognition, leaving this task to software \cite{MARTIN:1273918} \cite{Segnet:2017:7803544}.

% In recent years, new practical applications have started to be proposed, such as disease detection in imaging exams, recognition of objects, vehicles, and fire outbreaks in aerial images, and segmentation of images for autonomous vehicles.
% These applications seek to improve performance and lower health care costs, map structures in aerial photographs, ensure environmental maintenance and prevent automotive accidents, providing better quality of life for people \cite{Akkus:2017}, \cite{Kumar:2020}, \cite{Pham:2020}, \cite{Wu:2018}.

% The methods that exist today, despite the greater precision compared to some years ago, can be improved to allow total reliability in automatic systems.
% Medical diagnoses, in the future, can be analyzed entirely by algorithms; plantation can be monitored by software to prevent fires; and autonomous vehicles can become the safest way to go from one place to another.
% Thus, machine and deep learning researches are needed so that these activities can be carried out entirely by software.

%DEFINIÇÃO DO PROBLEMA
% \subsection{Problem Definition}
% \label{cap1_def_problema}

Segmentation subdivides an image into its constituent regions or objects, while edge detection techniques identify the boundaries between objects \cite{gonzalez2002digital}.
An edge, according to \cite{gonzalez2002digital}, is defined as a set of connected pixels that border two regions.

In addition to \cite{gonzalez2002digital}'s definition, \cite{MARTIN:1273918} subdivide edge detection into boundary detection and the classical edge detection.
For them, edge is ``an abrupt change in some low-level image feature such as brightness or color'' while boundary ``is a contour in the image plane that represents a change in pixel ownership from one object or surface to another'' \cite{MARTIN:1273918}. 

\cite{Jain:1995} defines contours as a link between edges and a representation of region boundaries.
Closed contours represents region boundaries and open contours are parts of region boundaries \cite{Jain:1995}.
Contours can be combined into a UCM representation, an indexed hierarchy of regions as a soft boundaries \cite{Arbelaez:2006}.

Region segmentation, object and boundary detection are correlated tasks.
Object limits with its high-level information can be used to define boundaries location.
Also, boundaries can limit pixels into regions \cite{MARTIN:1273918}.
This correlation allows one problem to be modeled on another and effective techniques can be shared between them.

Traditional segmentation methods use basic image properties to find discontinuities that can indicate objects, regions or borders.
However, these techniques face practical problems, such as similar color patterns, noise, and multiple thresholds for groups of images.
To solve this, nowadays, its common to use deep learning supervised methods (especially CNNs), in which image characteristics are learned by algorithms \cite{MARTIN:1273918} \cite{Segnet:2017:7803544}.

\begin{comment}
In recent years, CNNs have emerged to solve increasingly complicated applications.
%The emergence of them in object detection and classification started with AlexNet's impressive performance in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), by decreasing the top 5 state-of-art error by more than 10\% \cite[Ch. 1]{Goodfellow2016} \cite{Krizhevsky:2012} \cite{ILSVRC15}.
After the rise of CNNs, some architectures have emerged to produce region segmentation/classification and edge detection \cite[Ch. 1]{Goodfellow2016} \cite{Segnet:2017:7803544}.
In edge detection, HED architecture have emerged using intermediate outputs to produce maps in different scales, that are combined generating a final proposition \cite{HED:2015}.
%This new architecture dropped BSDS500 state-of-art value in almost 3\% and became a trend in boundary detection.
\end{comment}

Due to their architectures, a common CNN produces different information along its layers.
Each layer contributes specifically to the final result, with its own characteristics, that indicates how weights are adjusted by the network.
Furthermore, the network produces information in different sizes along the layers, due convolutional and pooling operations \cite{VGGNET:2014} \cite{Zeiler:2014} \cite{Fidler:2007} \cite{Hadji:2018}. %, that can be combined to produce a single output.

In order to combine these information at scale, some works such as HED, RCF and BDCN trained convolutional blocks individually, with specific loss functions for each of them.
This procedure aims to produce macro and detailed information, which are later combined into a single map \cite{Xie:2017:HED:3158436.3158453} \cite{RCF:2019} \cite{He:2019}. 
%This option, however, does not take advantage of existing similar tasks and results, once force several layers to produce the same result, increasing training cost.

\begin{comment}
To enhance training speed and accuracy, many projects developed its own loss functions and techniques to combine intermediate results, extracted from the network and called side-outputs.
Also, they made some changes in well-known convolutional networks, as VGG16 \cite{VGGNET:2014} and ResNet \cite{RESNET:2016:7780459}, adding extra ones to create new features and refine intermediate results \cite{DeepStructured:2017:Xu20173962} \cite{COB:2016} \cite{ProeminentEdge:2018:Cai2018}.

This work seeks to simplify this idea, proposing and evaluating some simple network architectures, based in some recent papers.
Also, it will be evaluate the capacity of obtain good results without forcing layers to produce similar information.
%This approach allows the information from a model for a specific task (e.g. region segmentation) to be easily adapted, with little training, for a similar task (e.g. edge detection).
%This approach allows to adapt a model for a specific task (e.g. region segmentation) to a similar one (e.g. edge detection).

To evaluate the methodology, our work will show results obtained in the tasks of region segmentation and edge detection.
The task of region segmentation was addressed in our previous work \cite{Reis:2019} and, at this stage, we will focus mainly, but not only, in edge detection.
}

{\color{red}
In edge detection we will refine the results of our previous work in a more difficult task, that allow us to check the best method.
Also, this paper will address how to increase training speed and performance with simple transformation in the ground truth of edging detection.

%This work also developed generic loss functions and trivial operations to combine side-outputs, such as average, maximum and sum.
%The creation of simple or even trivial methods favors the use in different scenarios.
